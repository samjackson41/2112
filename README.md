Repo for misc code blocks needed for websites for my job at 2112 industries

I ran into an issue where the <script> tags weren't working for all users for the dropdown menu toggleMenu() function, so I had to add a new custom child theme to blocksy to enqueue the function through there.  I uploaded that new child theme here for visibility. Here are some links to further clarify what I did for reference:
